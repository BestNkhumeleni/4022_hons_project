# 4022_hons_project


Clone this repo and right outside of it, create a folder named Data, inside of that (Data), create 4 folders, pcap_files, Raw_Videos, testing_data and training_data.

fill Raw data with the videos you wanna use as training material, use varying resolutions.

run mininet_setup.py with sudo access and everthing from there should be automatic, at the end of the runtime you should have a fully trained ML model.
